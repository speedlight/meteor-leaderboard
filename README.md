Meteor app based on meteortips.com tutorial
I added semantic:ui-css package.

I'll going to be updating this litle app from time to time as I keep learning Meteor.

Now I have this todos in mind:

- Add Admin type account, so only an admin can remove a player and add/take points. And make an account as admin :)
- Some validations like add player submit needs the fields player / score filed. Min and max points.
- Make a basic file structure: client/server/style etc..

The purpose is to have a basic Meteor app so more people can learn from this, and the app can work as a base app to modify for other purposes.
