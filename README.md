Meteor app based on meteortips.com tutorial
Added semantic:ui-css package.
Added accounts-ui and accounts-password.
Removed autopusblish and insecure.

I'll going to be updating this litle app from time to time as I keep learning Meteor.

Now I have this todos in mind:

- Add Admin type account, so only an admin can remove a player and add/take points. And make an account as admin :)
- Some form validations and restrictions
- Set min and max points.
- Make a basic file structure: client/server/style etc..

The purpose is to have a basic Meteor app so more people can learn from this, and the app can work as a base app to modify for other purposes.
